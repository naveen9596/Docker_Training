After editing the HTML file in a Docker container, you can view the changes in your web server by following these steps:

### Steps to View Edited HTML File on Web Server

1. **Ensure the Web Server is Running**:
   Make sure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) inside the container is running. You can check this by listing the running processes or using Docker logs.

2. **Access the Web Server**:
   Access the web server using your web browser. You need to know the IP address and the port on which the container is running. If you are running the container locally, it is often bound to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

### Example

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **List Running Containers**:
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                NAMES
   1a2b3c4d5e6f   nginx          "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   3 hours ago   Up 3 hours   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   my_nginx
   ```

   In this example, the Nginx container `my_nginx` is running and exposing port 80.

2. **Edit the HTML File Inside the Container**:
   Follow the previous steps to enter the container and edit the HTML file.

3. **Verify the Web Server is Running**:
   Inside the container, you can check if Nginx is running:
   ```sh
   ps aux | grep nginx
   ```
   You can also check the logs:
   ```sh
   docker logs my_nginx
   ```

4. **Access the Web Server**:
   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:80` (assuming the container is mapped to port 80 on the host). If you have configured a different port, use that port number.

### Additional Notes

- **Port Mapping**: Ensure the Docker container port is mapped to the host port. This is usually specified during container startup. For example:
  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my_nginx nginx
  ```

- **Firewall and Security Groups**: If you are running the Docker container on a remote server (e.g., AWS EC2), ensure the security groups and firewall settings allow traffic to the appropriate port.

- **Container Restart**: Sometimes, a simple restart of the container is necessary to apply changes, especially if configuration files other than HTML are modified.
  ```sh
  docker restart my_nginx
  ```

### Summary

1. Edit the HTML file inside the container.
2. Ensure the web server inside the container is running.
3. Access the web server via a web browser using the container's exposed port.

By following these steps, you can view your changes on the web server. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
