The error message `denied: requested access to the resource is denied` typically occurs when you are trying to push a Docker image to a repository that you do not have access to. This can happen for several reasons, including:

1. **Incorrect Repository Name**: The repository name may not be correctly formatted or may not belong to you.
2. **Authentication Issues**: You might not be logged in to Docker Hub, or your login session may have expired.
3. **Permissions**: You might not have the necessary permissions to push to the specified repository.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

#### Step 1: Log in to Docker Hub
Make sure you are logged in to Docker Hub with the correct credentials.

```sh
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted.

#### Step 2: Tag the Image Correctly
Ensure that you are tagging the image with the correct repository name. The repository name should be in the format `username/repository:tag`.

For example, if your Docker Hub username is `mydockerhubuser`, you should tag your image like this:

```sh
docker tag myhttpd/httpd:V1 mydockerhubuser/httpd:V1
```

#### Step 3: Push the Image to Your Repository
Push the image to your Docker Hub repository using the correct tag.

```sh
docker push mydockerhubuser/httpd:V1
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```sh
   docker login
   ```

2. **Build your Docker Image (if not already built)**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t myhttpd/httpd:V1 .
   ```

3. **Tag the Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker tag myhttpd/httpd:V1 mydockerhubuser/httpd:V1
   ```

4. **Push the Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker push mydockerhubuser/httpd:V1
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Check Repository Name**: Ensure the repository name you are pushing to matches exactly with the repository name in your Docker Hub account.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository if you are pushing to a team or organization repository.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about the specific commands you are using and the exact error messages you receive. This will help in diagnosing the issue further.
